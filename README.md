## Story

## Characters

### Cole (Fire) (Guitar)
Fiery and daring. Short to temper.

### Ariana (Air) (Vocals)
Whispy, hippy, and a little ditsy.

### Adam (Earth) (Drums)
Reliable, solid and steady. Doesn't move fast, but will assuradly move forward

### River (Water) (Bass)
Quiet, a little hard to contain. Sometimes distractible. Always cool.

### Erref
Stupid almost unnecessary side kick, cheerleader, comic relief
They will hide if there's trouble and talk smack once trouble is averted.
Provides tutorial information

## Level/Environment Design

Map of the town from the 4 characters homes and the coffee shop in the middle.
There will be trees, bushes, and grass land,
There will be rocks, and sidewalks, maybe layered land.
There will be obstacles of rivers (maybe created because river used water power), downed trees (maybe because Adam or Ariana used the power of Earth or Air).
Downed power lines will also start fires

## Gameplay

A town of obstacles that will need to be mitigated in order for the characters to eventually reach the coffee house.

## Art

Low poly 
Probably very bold colors especially to show the diferrences between the 4 elemental characters.

## Sound and Music

Rock Theme because this is a rock band... Different theme when gameplay switches between characters. Chords for power. Maybe switch between F, Bb, G#, D (Teen spirit?) each time the power is used. Drums for Adams moves.
Hoping for speech for at least Erref and will want singing for Ariel?
