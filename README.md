# BandAde

## Story
Adam sitting on the couch. He is a member of the once popular band The Elementals. He gets a call from the other members of the band. The coffee house where they got their start is going into forclosure. They want to save the place with a charity show. They'll get a charity event where the band gets together one last time to save the coffee house.
(Based on the theme "Cliche" for Game Jam 2022.)

## Characters

### Cole (Fire) (Guitar)
Fiery and daring. Short to temper.

### Ariana (Air) (Vocals)
Whispy, hippy, and a little ditsy.

### Adam (Earth) (Drums)
Reliable, solid and steady. Doesn't move fast, but will assuradly move forward

### River (Water) (Bass)
Quiet, a little hard to contain. Sometimes distractible. Always cool.


### Erref
Stupid almost unnecessary side kick, cheerleader, comic relief
They will hide if there's trouble and talk smack once trouble is averted.
Provides tutorial information

## Level/Environment Design

Map of the town with four homes toward the south (bottom), a hospital in the middle (a middle point and place to rejoin if there are monsters and "deaths")
The coffee house is to the north (top) of the map.
~~Map of the town from the 4 characters homes and the coffee shop in the middle.~~

There will be trees, bushes, and grass land,
There will be rocks, and sidewalks, maybe layered land.
There will be obstacles of rivers (~~maybe created because river used water power~~), downed trees (~~maybe because Adam or~~ Ariana used the power of ~~Earth or~~ Air).
~~Downed power lines will also start fires~~

## Gameplay

A town of obstacles that will need to be mitigated in order for the characters to eventually reach the coffee house.
Dead trees can be lit on FIRE or pushed over by WIND (if there is water behind it).
Ditches can be covered by EARTH or filled by WATER.
The four characters first work to get closer to each other to then cooperate their way through the puzzle.
(Possibly as they get closer, they will join to become one team.)
(Possibly as they get clsoer, monster will start attacking them.)

## Art

Low poly 
Probably very bold colors especially to show the diferrences between the 4 elemental characters.
(If time add greater character with more detailed characters.)

## Sound and Music

Rock Theme because this is a rock band... Different theme when gameplay switches between characters. Chords for power. Maybe switch between F, Bb, G#, D (Teen spirit?) each time the power is used. Drums for Adams moves.
Hoping for speech for at least Erref and will want singing for Ariel?

## User Interface, Game Controls
 WASD with E as an action button.
Arrows
Can work with game controller too.
(If time add touch screen control.)

UI menu at start of the game with credits.
(If time P for Pause)
(If time a volume controls on pause menu and menu button)

(If time see the face of character that's being controlled.)
